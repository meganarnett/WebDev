# WebDev

This is my heroku website https://secret-castle-21646.herokuapp.com/
I wasn't able to actually put the stylesheet on there so it's basically a black and white page. I guess I didn't write my code correctly.
The include files are in the index.php since I couldn't figure out how to do it on just homepage.php where all my code is.
